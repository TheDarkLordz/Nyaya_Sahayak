## Project Overview

Nyaya Sahayak is an innovative web application designed to democratize access to legal information in India. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, this platform allows users to ask legal questions in natural language and receive suggestions for relevant Indian laws and legal sections. The goal is to provide an educational tool that empowers individuals with foundational legal knowledge, bridging the gap between complex legal texts and everyday understanding.

**Disclaimer**: Nyaya Sahayak is intended for informational and educational purposes only. It is not a substitute for professional legal advice from a qualified lawyer. Always consult a legal expert for personalized guidance on legal matters.

## Technology Stack

Nyaya Sahayak is built using a modern, robust tech stack to ensure performance, scalability, and a seamless user experience:

- **Frontend**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React-based framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation for fast, optimized web applications.
- **Backend/API**: Serverless Functions within Next.js, leveraging Server Actions and Genkit flows for efficient and scalable backend operations.
- **AI Integration**: 
  - **Firebase Genkit** paired with **Google Gemini** models to power intelligent legal suggestions.
  - **ChatGPT** (via OpenAI) for additional natural language processing capabilities, enhancing the AI's ability to interpret user queries.
- **Database & Storage**: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), an open-source Firebase alternative, used for managing data, authentication, and real-time updates.
- **Deployment**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), a platform for effortless deployment and hosting of Next.js applications, ensuring global scalability and performance.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-first design, allowing for rapid UI development and consistent theming across devices.

This combination of technologies ensures that Nyaya Sahayak is not only powerful and intelligent but also user-friendly and accessible to a wide audience.

## Getting Started with Development

To set up and run Nyaya Sahayak locally for development or testing purposes, follow these detailed steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you havenâ€™t already, clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone 
   cd nyaya-sahayak
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required npm packages.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory to store sensitive configurations such as API keys for Firebase, Google Gemini, OpenAI, Supabase, and other services.
   ```bash
   echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url" >> .env.local
   echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key" >> .env.local
   echo "GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key" >> .env.local
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key" >> .env.local
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server**: Start the Next.js application locally. By default, it will be accessible at `http://localhost:9002`.
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Run Genkit for AI Flow Development**: If youâ€™re working on or testing AI flows with Genkit, use the following commands:
   - For a one-time run:
     ```bash
     npm run genkit:dev
     ```
   - For continuous watching of changes:
     ```bash
     npm run genkit:watch
     ```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9002` to explore the application.
