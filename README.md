# Nyaya Sahayak - ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Indian Law Advice Website

Welcome to the official documentation for **Nyaya Sahayak**, a Next.js application designed to provide AI-driven legal information based on Indian laws. This platform allows users to ask legal questions in natural language, and the AI suggests potentially relevant legal sections to assist with their queries.

## Project Overview

Nyaya Sahayak is built with the mission of making Indian legal information more accessible to the general public. By leveraging artificial intelligence, the application interprets user queries and directs them to relevant laws and legal sections. This tool serves as an educational resource to help users better understand legal frameworks in India.

**Disclaimer**: The information provided by Nyaya Sahayak is for educational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for professional legal advice from a qualified lawyer.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (a React-based framework for building modern web applications)
- **Backend/API**: Serverless Functions integrated within Next.js, utilizing Server Actions and Genkit flows for seamless API operations
- **AI Integration**: Firebase Genkit paired with Google AI models to power intelligent legal suggestions

## Getting Started with Development

Follow these steps to set up and run the Nyaya Sahayak project locally for development purposes:

- **Install Dependencies**: Open your terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command to install the required packages:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- **Set Up Environment Variables**: Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project to store API keys or other configurations necessary for Genkit or Google AI integration.

- **Run the Development Server**: Start the Next.js application with the following command. By default, it will run on `http://localhost:9002`:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- **Run Genkit for AI Flow Development**: If you are working on or testing Genkit flows locally, use one of these commands:
  - For a one-time run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
  - For continuous watching of changes:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```

## Core Features

- **AI Law Suggestion Tool**: A user-friendly interface where individuals can input legal questions in natural language. The AI processes these queries and suggests relevant Indian laws or legal sections.
- **Instructions Page**: An informational section that explains how the application works and includes a disclaimer about the educational nature of the tool.
